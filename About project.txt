Project Name: Vector Similarity Engine

Project Type: Python begineer AI/ML project(No advanced libraries initially)

Goal:
Create a python program that can compute similarity between vectors.
Each vector represents a concepts, object or data point. By comparing vectors, We can find
which items are "closest" to a given target.

Example Use Case:

We have vectors representing fruits:

apple = [1, 0, 0]

banana = [0, 1, 0]

orange = [0, 0, 1]

We want to know which fruit is most similar to target = [1, 0, 0].

The engine computes similarity scores and tells us apple is closest, banana and orange are less similar.

Key Concepts Covered (Beginner + AI Perspective):

Python basics: variables, loops, lists, functions, classes

Python intermediate: list/dict comprehensions, scope, methods

AI foundation: vectors, dot product, magnitude, cosine similarity

Object-oriented programming: reusable engine class

Scalability: Later can replace manual lists with NumPy arrays or real AI embeddings
